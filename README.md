# Balls simulator
  The program simulate balls behaviour with interaction force between each other: $F(r) = 1/r - 1/r^2$.
  - Balls can walk trough each other.
  - Balls has an elastic reflection from the walls.
  - Balls can be created, moved or deleted.
  - Simulation and UI are running in separate threads.
  - GTest is required for tests.
